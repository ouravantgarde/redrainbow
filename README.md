And the world would move on without you, would it not?

Should you give up, the souls will shift around you, the environment warping and growing and decaying. Those who wronged or gifted you, living or dying, not at your hands.

Till you are nothing more than simple art, nature, of such a beautiful world. Another ambience.

Let me remake you, and mend you, and you can be so much more...

_The art that creates art._
